# Helpful Definitions

Here at Flatiron School, we define a **people manager** as someone who oversees at least one direct report, is responsible for said direct reportâ€™s success, and is accountable for achieving team business results 

Some employees at Flatiron School may have titles like "Senior Manager" which reflects management of a given task or project on an ongoing basis. That said, for these purposes we are referring to people managers only.

We have people managers across all teams at Flatiron School and they exist at different levels of seniority (Manager, Senior Manager, Director, VP, C-Suite)
