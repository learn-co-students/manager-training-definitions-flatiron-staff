# Who is a People Manager?

Here at Flatiron School, we define a *people manager* as someone who oversees at least one direct report, is responsible for said direct reportâ€™s success, and is accountable for achieving team business results 

Some employees at Flatiron School may have titles like "Senior Manager" that reflects management of a given task or project on an ongoing basis, but for these purposes we are referring to people managers only.
